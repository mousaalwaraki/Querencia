## Summary

Using firebase as a backend, I created a Q&A type of journal app.   
Prompts are provided in the inspiration  to help inspire users to make the prompts their own (or just add it as is), as that was one of the difficulties that users were facing.  
Added a resources page that include videos, blogposts and book recommendations to keep users motivated and using the app.  
Biometric/Passcode lock added to improve security features.   
Daily notification reminders to journal at time of users choice.   
Calendar to review journal entries, with journaled dates highlighted so users can see what days they should review. Date picker to help navigate dates quicker.   

## Challenges

Keeping a minimalistic UI throughout app was challenging, but need to ensure journalling is made as simple as possible.   
Syncing question prompts on all pages including the journalling page (where users write their answers).    
Removing prompts from inspiration after user adds them.    
Biometric/passcode integration was new, however got the hang of it quickly and was simpler than expected.   
To not send notifications if user already journaled was relatively difficult especially that the database is set up to create an empty document in the database when user opens app.    
Showing events on the calendar when user has journaled, especially as it was a 3rd party library and weren't too many available documents.

Querencia is the area in the arena taken by the bull to draw it's power and be at ease in a fight. It's the place where the bull feels safest and most at home.

I believe that your journal is equivilant to that. It's a safe environment where you reflect on yourself, feel safe from judgement, be yourself completely and unapologetically! After all this journal is made by you, for you. So don't hold back, be yourself, reflect and learn!

Querencia is designed to make journaling as simple as possible, to encourage individuals to build a sustainable habit of journaling using a simple format of Q&As. This is a very good way to encourage people to begin journaling, and with customisable questions, your journal will grow as you do!

Journaling is an ancient tradition that dates to at least the 10th century! Journaling has many documented benefits, by many different individuals and cultures all around the world. These benefits including reducing intrusion and avoidance symptoms post-trauma, improving working memory, clarifying your thoughts and feelings and many more!

So give it a shot and see the improvements yourself!
